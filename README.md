# Glaucoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to assist in the detection of glaucoma from eye images. Glaucoma is a disease affecting the vision of the human eye, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The CNN helps differentiate patterns between glaucoma and non-glaucoma images using a hierarchical structure.

## Concept
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilized for detecting glaucoma.
- **Disease**: Glaucoma, related to human eye vision.
- **Pattern Differentiation**: CNN distinguishes patterns in glaucoma vs. non-glaucoma images.
- **Model Architecture**: Six layers used for evaluation.

## Steps
1. **Collect Image Data**: Gather a labeled dataset of eye images (glaucoma and non-glaucoma).
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Normalize, augment, and split data into training, validation, and test sets.
3. **Model the Architecture**: Define the CNN structure.
4. **Train the Dataset Model**: Fit the model using the training data.
5. **Validation and Testing**: Validate and test the model with separate sets.
6. **Model Interpretation and Deployment**: Analyze and deploy the trained model.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- os

## Dataset and Methodology
The dataset for this project, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 100 eye images, with 50 images of glaucoma and 50 healthy images, in various formats and sizes. The methodology involves several key steps: collecting and organizing images into separate folders for glaucoma and healthy eyes; preprocessing by normalizing pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 and applying data augmentation techniques such as shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping; resizing all images to 128x128 pixels and splitting 20% of the data for validation. The model architecture features a CNN with layers including an input layer with 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel size, and ReLU activation; multiple convolutional layers with increasing filters and ReLU activation; MaxPooling layers; a Flatten layer; a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation; and an output layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation for binary classification. Training uses the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metrics over 10 epochs. Validation uses 20% of the dataset, and the remaining test images evaluate model performance. Performance metrics such as loss and accuracy are monitored, and the trained model is saved for future use.

## Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```

## Usage

### 1. Dataset Preparation
Ensure your dataset is organized in a directory with subdirectories for each class (glaucoma and non-glaucoma). Update the `dataset_path` variable with the path to your dataset.

### 2. Preprocess the Data
Use `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and normalization.

### 3. Define the CNN Model
Create the CNN model with six layers for evaluation.

### 4. Train the Model
Train the model with the training data and validate using the validation set.

### 5. Save the Trained Model
Save the trained model for future use.

### 6. Model Output
Ensure the model outputs appropriate logs during training to monitor performance.

### Common Issues and Fixes
- **Incorrect Loss Values**: Verify data preprocessing steps and model architecture.
- **Accuracy Stagnation**: Experiment with different model architectures, data augmentation techniques, and hyperparameters.

## conclusion
This project showcases the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting glaucoma from eye images. By adhering to the provided steps, you can preprocess the data, establish an appropriate model architecture, train the model, validate its effectiveness, and deploy the trained model for practical use. Enhancing and optimizing this method can play a crucial role in early glaucoma detection, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes.
